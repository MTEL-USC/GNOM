This repository holds the code and data for the global steady-state model of the marine neodymium (Nd) cycle as described in [*Pasquier, Hines, et al.* (in prep.)]().

This ReadMe serves as documentation for running the GNOM model in [Julia](https://julialang.org/).
Thanks to Julia's excellent built-in package manager and the [DataDeps.jl](https://github.com/oxinabox/DataDeps.jl) package, no setup should be required apart from installing Julia, downloading the GEOTRACES dataset, and activating the GNOM environment.

Check the table of contents (there should be a button on the top left) to navigate this file efficiently.

## Installation

1. Download and install the latest stable version of Julia from [julialang.org](https://julialang.org/) (v1.6.2 as of 1 Sep 2021).
1. Download or clone this repository on your local machine.
1. (Optional) If you want to use the observational dataset used in GNOM v1.0, you must manually download the neodymium data from the GEOTRACES Intermediate Data Product 2017 (IDP17). (This is the only piece of data that cannot be programmatically downloaded for this project.)
    Head over to [www.geotraces.org](https://www.geotraces.org/) to download the IDP17 discrete sample dataset and, following the [GEOTRACES.jl](https://github.com/briochemc/GEOTRACES.jl) recommendation, you should preferably save the NetCDF file locally at

    ```bash
    $HOME/Data/GEOTRACES/GEOTRACES_IDP2017_v2/discrete_sample_data/netcdf/GEOTRACES_IDP2017_v2_Discrete_Sample_Data.nc
    ```

    where `$HOME` is your "home" directory.
    All other data required for running the GNOM and its optimization (including ocean-circulation models, non-IDP17 Nd data, World Ocean Atlas data, and so on) are downloaded programmatically during the model setup.



## Single model run

### Run the optimized GNOM v1.0

The GNOM v1.0 output was generated by optimizing a bunch of parameters (see [*Pasquier, Hines, et al.* (in prep.)]() for parameter values and details).
You can reproduce the same output in just a few seconds on your laptop by following these simple 3 steps:

1. Go to ([`cd`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cd_%28command%29)) to the GNOM folder.
2. Start Julia
3. In Julia, type

    ```julia
    julia> include("src/Nd_model/single_run.jl")
    ```

This sets the model up with the optimized parameters and runs a single simulation of the GNOM, which should take a few seconds to a few minutes, depending if it's the first time that you are running the file. (Unless there is an `ERROR` thrown out, you can safely ignore the warnings and information printed out.)

### The single run output

The [`src/Nd_model/single_run.jl`](src/Nd_model/single_run.jl) file creates two variables, `DNd` and `εNd`, which contain the vectors for the Nd concentration (in mol/m<sup>−3</sup>) and ε<sub>Nd</sub> (unitless).
(It also saves the parameters used in a newly created folder in `output/single_runs/` for safekeeping.)

Because the `εNd` vector is the last computed variable, the output should end with something like

```julia
200160-element Vector{Float64}:
 -0.0006020528949600701
 -0.000595097968841718
  ⋮
 -0.0013770493809266426
 -0.001364787766450326
```

although the actual numerical values might be different.

These are the ε<sub>Nd</sub> values that you can convert to parts per ten thousand (‱) by typing, e.g.,

```julia
julia> εNd .|> εunit
200160-element Vector{Quantity{Float64, NoDims, Unitful.FreeUnits{(‱,), NoDims, nothing}}}:
  -6.020528949600701 ‱
 -5.9509796884171795 ‱
                     ⋮
 -13.770493809266426 ‱
  -13.64787766450326 ‱
```

where `εunit` is the ‱ unit.

Similarly, you can convert `DNd` to pM by doing:

```julia
julia> DNd * mol/m^3 .|> pM
200160-element Vector{Quantity{Float64, 𝐍 𝐋⁻³, Unitful.FreeUnits{(pM,), 𝐍 𝐋⁻³, nothing}}}:
  1.450921127576513 pM
 1.4497239997396394 pM
                     ⋮
 38.646836627631856 pM
 34.017114010235964 pM
```

where here we additionally had to apply the default unit (mol m<sup>−3</sup>) before converting.
(The units used here, e.g., `mol` and `pM`, have been preloaded from [Unitful.jl](https://github.com/PainterQubits/Unitful.jl).)

### Exploring different parameters values

You can edit the parameter values in [`src/Nd_model/single_run.jl`](src/Nd_model/single_run.jl) and run it again to simulate the [Nd] and ε<sub>Nd</sub> fields for different parameter values.

If you encounter any errors, please share what you did and the stacktrace in a GitHub issue and we will try to troubleshoot the issue with you as fast as possible.

## Plotting

There many packages for plotting in Julia.
Here we just document two of them: [Plots.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/Plots.jl) and [Makie.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/Makie.jl).

### with Plots.jl

The most popular plotting package is [Plots.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/Plots.jl) and AIBECS.jl provides recipes for it.
To use the Plots.jl package, simply type

```julia
julia> using Plots
```

The vectors of tracers, such as `DNd` and `εNd`, can be easily plotted with the AIBECS recipes.
For example, after running the single run above, you can use

```julia
julia> plotverticalmean(εNd .|> εunit, grd, c=:balance)
```

which will output something like

![plot_GNOM_demo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4486578/133375278-623b1e7d-4b52-4806-beec-db5be82bac32.png)

For more plot types, see the [AIBECS documentation](https://juliaocean.github.io/AIBECS.jl/stable/), which contains [example tutorials](https://juliaocean.github.io/AIBECS.jl/stable/#.-Tutorials) and [how-to guides](https://juliaocean.github.io/AIBECS.jl/stable/#.-How-to-guides) with simple plots.

### with Makie.jl

#### Reproducing figures from the GNOM paper

After your single run, you can reproduce the figures of the GNOM paper by running the scripts located in [`src/plots/GMDpaper/`](src/plots/GMDpaper/).
For example, to reproduce the ε<sub>Nd</sub> transects (Fig. 10 in [*Pasquier, Hines, et al.* (in prep.)]()), you can type

```julia
julia> include("src/plots/GMDpaper/transects_eNd.jl")
```

and it will produce a figure similar to

![eNd_transects_single_run10](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4486578/133563204-47901894-fbd2-4bae-8018-26d1da9900d0.jpg)

Note that Makie.jl comes with multiple backends, of which GNOM includes GLMakie (that I would use for interactive plot windows) and CairoMakie (that I would use for PDFs).
The Makie backend is set to GLMakie in [`src/Nd_model/single_run.jl`](src/Nd_model/single_run.jl) by setting the variable `use_GLMakie = true`.
If you want to generate PDFs, use CairoMakie by editing the line to `use_GLMakie = false`.
(If you switch between GLMakie and CairoMakie, you must rerun the `load.jl` file, which you can do by simply setting `reload = true` before running any of the figure scripts.)


#### Why Makie and how to plot without the Plots.jl recipes?

The figures in [*Pasquier, Hines, et al.* (in prep.)]() were created with [Makie.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/Makie.jl) because it provides finer control to create detailed publication-quality PDFs.
Although AIBECS.jl does *not* provide recipes for Makie.jl, there are a number of AIBECS functions to rearrange the 1D column vectors into 3D and take slices/averages over given regions/depths.
For example, in line with the Plots.jl recipe used above for the vertical mean of ε<sub>Nd</sub>, you can get the 2D array of the vertical mean with

```julia
julia> verticalmean(εNd .|> εunit, grd)
91×180 Matrix{Quantity{Float64, NoDims, Unitful.FreeUnits{(‱,), NoDims, nothing}}}:
      NaN ‱      NaN ‱  …       NaN ‱       NaN ‱
      NaN ‱      NaN ‱          NaN ‱       NaN ‱
          ⋮             ⋱
 -11.7113 ‱  -11.709 ‱     -11.7166 ‱  -11.7138 ‱
      NaN ‱      NaN ‱  …       NaN ‱       NaN ‱
```

(where `NaN`s represent land/dry model grid cells.)

Such functions are extensively used by the plotting scripts in [`src/plots/GMDpaper/`](src/plots/GMDpaper/), which you can directly use to reproduce the plots in [*Pasquier, Hines, et al.* (in prep.)]().




## Optimization

To run the optimization, you can type

```julia
include("src/Nd_model/setup_and_optimization.jl")
```

Beware that this will take a few hours on a modern laptop!

This optimization script will randomize the initial value for the parameter values by taking a random sample from the prior distributions determined by the initial guess and the range defined in the parameter type (the `Params` struct in the `model_setup.jl` file).


## Si model

When running the Nd-cycling single run, the optimized Si-cycling fields required for opal scavenging are automatically downloaded from FigShare.
However, if you want, you can also edit the Si-cycle code and re-optimize it.

To run the Si-model optimization on your laptop, call

```julia
include("src/Si_model/setup_and_optimization.jl")
```

Just like for the Nd-cycle model, you can modify the Si-cycle model in [`src/Si_model/model_setup.jl`](src/Si_model/model_setup.jl)



## Running on a SLURM cluster

The GNOM v1.0 outputs for [*Pasquier, Hines, et al.* (in prep.)]() were generated using a [SLURM](https://slurm.schedmd.com/overview.html) cluster, for which batch scripts were written in this repository.

If you have access to a cluster with the SLURM workload manager, you should be able to run the optimizations by
1. Cloning this repository on your cluster,
2. Have Julia installed,
3. And after `cd`ing to the GNOM directory, typing

    ```bash
    sbatch src/slurm/optimize_Nd.sh
    ```

This SLURM batch file will request 1 node with 64GB for 20 hours.

Similarly, there is also a batch script for optimizing the Si-cycle model, [`src/slurm/optimize_Nd.sh`](src/slurm/optimize_Nd.sh).



## Citation

To cite the GNOM v1 model, please cite [*Pasquier, Hines, et al.* (in prep.)]().
You can use the journal's citation tools, directly grab the contents of our [CITATION.bib](CITATION.bib) file or simply use:

> Pasquier, B., Hines, S., Liang, H., Wu, Y., John, S., and Goldstein, S.: *GNOM v1.0: An optimized steady-state model of the modern marine neodymium cycle*, in preparation for submission to Geosci. Model Dev.

## Changelog
